# SEC Company Shares Outstanding Viewer This project is a single-page responsive web application that fetches and displays the maximum and minimum shares outstanding for a given company, based on data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The application is built with vanilla JavaScript and styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive user interface. ## Features - **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Retrieves company data directly from the SEC EDGAR API. - **CIK Parameter Support**: Allows specifying a CIK (Central Index Key) in the URL to view data for any public company. - **Max/Min Shares Display**: Clearly highlights the highest and lowest shares outstanding post-2020. - **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS. - **SEC Guidance Compliant**: Sets a descriptive `User-Agent` header for API requests as per SEC guidelines. ## How to Use ### Local Setup 1. Save the `index.html`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` files into a directory. 2. Open `index.html` in your web browser. ### Viewing Specific Companies You can view data for different companies by appending a `CIK` query parameter to the URL. For example: - `index.html` (Displays data for Booking Holdings, CIK: 0001075531) - `index.html?CIK=0001018724` (Displays data for Apple Inc., CIK: 0001018724) ### Data Filtering The application filters shares outstanding data to include only entries where the fiscal year (`fy`) is greater than 2020 and the value (`val`) is a valid number. ## Attachments The `uid.txt` file is provided alongside this project. While not directly used or displayed within the HTML, it is part of the project's included assets. ## Technical Details - **SEC API Endpoint**: `https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK<CIK>/dei/EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding.json` - **Proxy Usage**: To circumvent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions when fetching data from the SEC API from a browser, a public CORS proxy (`https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=`) is utilized for demonstration. For production environments, consider implementing a dedicated backend proxy. ## License This project is open-sourced under the MIT License.
